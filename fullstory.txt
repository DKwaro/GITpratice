There was once a small fish called Nemo
Nemo lived in the deep sea far away from humans
Everyday Nemo went swimming with her friends, not so far from home
One day Nemo swam too far and got lost
Her dad was so worried
Baba Nemo decided to go on a mission to find Nemo
He searched everywhere in vain
Until one day as he was swimming by a boat he heard what sounded like Nemo´s voice
The boat was full of humans and there was no way to confirm if he actually heard Nemo´s voice
So he decided to whistle in fish language
Suddenly he heard Nemo whistling back in fish language
It was a language that humans could neither hear or understand
Right away he knew Nemo was in the boat
He wondered how he could get Nemo out of the boat and into the water
So he decided to call on his friend Beluga, the largest whale in the kingdom
